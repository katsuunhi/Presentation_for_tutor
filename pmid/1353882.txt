To ascertain whether variability in circulating osteocalcin levels may reflect allelic variation in the vitamin D receptor gene, we have analyzed the relationship between frequent restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs, detected by endonucleases Bsm I, EcoRV, and Apa I) that define human vitamin D receptor alleles and serum osteocalcin in a cohort of normal subjects.
