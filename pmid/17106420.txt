In this study we investigated a total of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and all possible haplotypes, of genes that have been previously implicated in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder - RGS4, PRODH, COMT and GRK3 - in a sample of 213 cases with bipolar affective disorder type 1 and 197 controls from Scotland.
